# Background
To navigate the data analytics job market effectively, this project helps pinpoint the top-paid and in-demand skills to find optimal jobs.

Data is from an online [SQL course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) that includes insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions asked that were answered through the SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying Data Analyts jobs?
2. What are the skills required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in-demand for Data Analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools Used
To dive into the Data Analyst job market, I've learned to use the following tools:

- **SQL** - the main tool for the analysis, allowing me to query the database and uncover insights.
- **Postgres** - the chosen database management system, ideal for handling job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code** - code editor for executing SQL queries.
- **Github / Git** - for version control and for sharing the SQL queries and analysis online.
- **Power BI** - a desktop application that can create visualizations such as graphs.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Data Analyst job market.  Here's how the following questions were approached:

### 1. Top-paying Data Analyts jobs
To identify the top paying roles, I filtered Data Analyst positions by location and average yearly salary, focusing on remote jobs. 

```sql
select 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name as company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
from job_postings_fact
left JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
where 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg is not null
order by salary_year_avg DESC
limit 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top Data Analyst jobs in 2023:
- Director and senior roles command higher salaries, while analyst roles have a wide salary range between $184,000 to $650,000.
- A significant number of jobs were posted in mid-to-late 2023, suggesting a steady demand for data professionals.
- Data analysis and leadership roles remain in high demand, with positions posted throughout 2023.

### 2. Skills required for these top-paying jobs
To identify the skills associated with the top paying jobs for Data Analytics in 2023, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights as to what employers value for high compensation roles. 

```sql
with top_jobs as (
    select 
        job_id,
        name as company_name,
        job_location,
        salary_year_avg
    from job_postings_fact
    left JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
    where 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg is not null
    order by salary_year_avg DESC
    limit 10
)

select
    top_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
from top_jobs
inner join skills_job_dim on top_jobs.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_dim.skill_id=skills_job_dim.skill_id
order by salary_year_avg DESC
```

Here's the breakdown of the skills required for these top paying jobs:
- SQL is the most in-demand skill, appearing in 8 job postings.
- Python, Tableau, and R are also highly sought after, each appearing at 4-7 times.
- Excel, Pandas, and Snowflake have moderate demand, showing up in 3 job postings.
- AWS, Azure, Power Bi, Jupyter appear less frequently, indicating they are required for fewer roles.
- A mix of programming, cloud, and BI tools is essential for top-paying data analyst roles.

## 3. Top 5 skills most in-demand for data analysts
To identify the skills across all the Data Analyst job postings, I joined the job postings with the skills job and the skills table, grouping the results by skill name.

```sql
select
    skills_dim.skills,
    count(*) as total
from job_postings_fact
inner join skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_dim.skill_id=skills_job_dim.skill_id
where job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
group by skills_dim.skills
order by total DESC
limit 5;
```

| Skills   | Total  |
|----------|--------|
| SQL      | 92,628 |
| Excel    | 67,031 |
| Python   | 57,326 |
| Tableau  | 46,554 |
| Power BI | 39,468 |



## 4. Skills that are associated with higher salaries
To identify the skills associated with higher salaries, I filtered Data Analyst positions from all locations offering remote jobs that includes salary information. Results were grouped by skills and the yearly salary averaged.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),0) as avg_skill_salary
from job_postings_fact
inner join skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_dim.skill_id=skills_job_dim.skill_id
where job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    and job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg is not NULL
    and job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = TRUE
group by skills_dim.skills
order by avg_skill_salary DESC
limit 25;
```

Based on the salary data, several key trends emerge regarding the highest-paying skills for data analysts:

- Advanced Tools & Programming Languages: Higher salaries are associated with specialized data processing tools (e.g., PySpark, DataRobot) and programming languages (e.g., Bitbucket, Swift).
- Data Processing & Analysis Skills: Proficiency in data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, Jupyter) and version control systems (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket) is well-compensated.
- Big Data, Cloud Platforms, & Database Management: Knowledge of big data platforms (e.g., Databricks), cloud platforms (e.g., GCP), and database management systems (e.g., Couchbase, PostgreSQL) leads to competitive salaries.
